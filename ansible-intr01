# what is an ansible?
=> ansible is an automation configration tool.

                 #.Advantages of the Ansible:

1.Mass diployment:http/service
           
    =>  10 services run with help of ansible without going to another machines and we use ssh.
    =>  we run and copy files with help of scripts but issues like run and copy files again and again on those 
        10 machines.

2.Migration test to production;
      
   =>  application testig environment test to production migration we can do with ansible.

3.Application failure;
   
   =>  ansible used to keep stable application.
   =>  ansible role back to previous stable.

  Code;pull from the software first and then run the machine.

# Chef:lang=rubby/erlang

  security;ssl/tls

  requirements; agent (any software)

  code; pull from the software first then run on the machine.
